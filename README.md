### Embrace the grind!

<!--
**bananabread08/bananabread08** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.--> 
I'm in my mid-twenties and I realized I love programming more than what I do in my day job. Got the courage to resign and go full-time (or use most of my time ðŸ˜‰) learning web-development under **The Odin Project**.

- [x] ðŸ”­ (Finished just in time. 01/31/21) Iâ€™m currently working on finishing the Foundations this month (January 2021) hopefully. I am excited to face the Fullstack Javascript course soon!
### More About Me:
- Currently learning more about React in general and started reading about Test Driven Development. 
- Currently working on my ~~non-existent~~ portfolio.
- ðŸ“º: I love watching Anime and Kdramas though I don't binge-watch. Just one episode or two (or three++!) per day.  
- ðŸ’ª: Upon starting the TOP Curriculum, I had a lifestyle change. I workout (halfway through the pandemic times!), eat healthy, fixed my body-clock. I am taking care of my body and myself in general. I'm sure it's not a placebo. 
- ðŸŽ®: I am a gamer, mostly on my phone and my Nintendo Switch. I ~~hate~~ love gacha games (I'm not a whale, I am telling you). I love JRPGs in general. Huge fan of the Pokemon franchise and Monster Hunter. Hit me up if you want to co-op.

My end-goal is to fulfill my career shift and get a fresh start as a Developer/Software Engineer.

## Back from my July 2021 break and ready to grind and learn again especially the Backend of JS!
