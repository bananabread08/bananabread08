### Learning something new daily!

I'm in my mid-twenties and I realized I love programming more than what I do in my day job. Got the courage to resign and go full-time (or use most of my time) learning web-development under **The Odin Project**.

- ðŸ”­[x] (Finished just in time. 01/31/21) Iâ€™m currently working on finishing the Foundations this month (January 2021) hopefully. I am excited to face the Fullstack Javascript course soon!
- :musical_note: Kpop and Anime songs give me adrenaline when coding/learning programming. Give those a try. 
- :muscle: Upon starting the TOP Curriculum, I had a lifestyle change. I workout (halfway through the pandemic times!), eat healthy, fixed my body-clock. I am taking care of my body and myself in general. I'm sure it's not a placebo. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a gamer, mostly on my phone and my Nintendo Switch. I ~~hate~~ love gacha games (I'm not a whale, I am telling you). I love JRPGs in general. Huge fan of the Pokemon franchise and Monster Hunter. Hit me up if you want to co-op.

My end-goal is to fulfill my career shift and get a Junior Developer job. :pray:
