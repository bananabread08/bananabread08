- [x] ðŸ”­ (Finished just in time. 01/31/21) Iâ€™m currently working on finishing the Foundations this month (January 2021) hopefully. I am excited to face the Fullstack Javascript course soon!
### More About Me:
- ðŸ’ª: Upon starting TOP, I had a lifestyle change. I workout (halfway through the pandemic times!), eat healthy, fixed my body-clock. I am taking care of my body and myself in general. I'm sure it's not a placebo. 
- ðŸŽ®: I love playing games, mostly on my phone and my Nintendo Switch. I love JRPGs in general.
- ðŸ“º: I enjoy reading mangas during my free time. 

My end-goal is to fulfill my career shift and get a fresh start as a Developer/Software Engineer.
